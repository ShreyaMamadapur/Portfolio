# About Me
I am a Technical Writer with two years of technical writing experience. In the past, I have worn other hats as well - that of a Software Engineer and a Teacher. I believe that these roles bring a lot of value to my current role of a Technical Writer. 

I have worked on both internal and external documentation for applications in the banking and medical device domains, using Microsoft Word, Confluence and AsciiDoc with Antora. I have also contributed to UX Writing and improved the user experience for the applications that I have worked on.

Some of my strengths:
- A quick learner
- Like to research and learn new technologies and applications
- Adapt well to changes and thrive in fast paced environments
- A positive team player and work well both as part of a team and independently
- Own my work and like to take on additional responsibilities when possible
