# Portfolio
This is my technical writing portfolio where I have tried to demonstrate my technical writing skills through a few samples of my writing.

## About me
I am a Technical Writer with two years of experience. In the past, I have worn other hats as well - that of a Software Engineer and a teacher. I believe that these roles bring a lot of value to my current role of a Technical Writer. 

I have worked on both internal and external documentation for applications in the banking and medical device domains, using Microsoft Word, Confluence and AsciiDoc with Antora. I have also contributed to UX Writing and improved the user experience for the applications that I have worked on.

I am a quick learner, and like to research and learn about new technologies and applications. I adapt well to changes and thrive in fast paced environments. I am a positive team player and work well both as part of a team and independently. I take ownership of my work and like to take on additional responsibilities as and when I have the bandwidth.
